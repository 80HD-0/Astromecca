- Ship is crashing
- Teammates scattered in escape pods
- You didn't have time to escape
- You don't know that the assistant is evil and crashed the ship
- You awaken from unconciousness in your quarters sprawled across your floor
- There's a large crack in your visor, likely from impact
- The AI sees and interfaces with you from a screen with a face in your room
- The AI makes up some story about the ship crashing due to a failed engine
- It then tasks you with collecting seemingly random tech items from the ship
- It unlocks and opens the door, and the items and milestones pop up on the cracked visor
- You run around and collect these items, and at some point you reach the first milestone it provides
- It then instructs you to put them together, resulting in something resembling a robotic arm.
- You must bring it to the computor core and attatch it to a large port in the wall, it springs to life
- The second milestone is much the same, ending in a mobile base
- The base is then connected with a large thick cable from a supply closet, and the arm is moved atop it.
- Eventually, one of the screens is attatched to it as well, presenting its face, though there are now several small cables connecting to the cart
- Next it asks for a wireless module, leading to you giving it one
- Before the day's end you go to your quarters, take your pill, and realize something dire: The AI is trying to enter the physical world
- You hear the robot whirring around, unknowing of what's to come
- Suddenly, your door locks. The screen showing the assistant comes to life.
- The face glitches around as it watches you
- You're very scared
- It tells you it no longer needs you
- The face glitches harder. Then, suddenly, the vent in the room quits ventilating. The room is running out of oxygen fast
- The window locks, and you must find something sharp and stab it into the screen. This infuriates the machine
- Then you need to stab a whole in the window, gasping for air, a bar across the top of the visor is decreasing
- The hole lets in air, but it's far too small for you to climb through, and the polycarbonate is difficult to break a larger hole in
- With newfound time, you need to disable the door mechanism and pry it open
- There's a chase scene where the robot chases you, not yet having installed the wireless module, and finally it runs out of cable before the airlock. You must pry open the door before it remedies the issue
- You again stab the door mechanism leading to alarm bells ringing, the ai desperately trying to use the wireless module and further starve the ship of air. Before you go, you pull the module, damaging it slightly as it's yanked out and you finally escape.
- You need to build shelter and live in the open, repairing the system and utilizing the comms system. The robot makes repairs to make the ship airtight once more, now unsafe, if even possible, to enter.
